# Abstract
Swarm-Merging, SwarMer, is a decentralized framework to localize Flying Light Specks (FLSs) to render 2D and 3D shapes.  An FLS is a miniature sized drone equipped with one or more light sources to generate different colors and textures with adjustable brightness.  It is battery powered, network enabled with storage and processing capability to implement a decentralized algorithm such as SwarMer.  An FLS is unable to render a shape by itself.  SwarMer uses the inter-FLS relationship effect of its organizational framework to compensate for the simplicity of each individual FLS, enabling a swarm of cooperating FLSs to render complex shapes.  SwarMer is resilient to network packet loss, FLSs failing, and FLSs leaving to charge their battery.  It is fast, highly accurate, and scales to remain effective when a shape consists of a large number of FLSs.
