# Abstract
The Flying Light Speck (FLS) is a compact drone designed with versatile light sources that emit diverse colors and textures, offering adjustable brightness levels. This technology plays a crucial role in realizing the concept of holodecks, where a collective swarm of FLS units collaborates to provide illumination through algorithmic operations and seamless real-time information exchange. This necessitates a proper physical link (PHY) among the FLS drones, imposing stringent requirements on the network infrastructure. This paper presents the essential requirements, explores various technologies suitable for establishing the physical links, and proposes a comprehensive evaluation plan to compare and assess the candidates.
