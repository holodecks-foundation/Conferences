# Abstract
A Flying Light Speck, FLS, is a miniature sized drone configured with light sources to illuminate 3D multimedia objects in a fixed volume, an FLS display.  A swarm of FLSs may provide haptic interactions by exerting force back at a user's touch.  This paper presents a conceptual model for the multimedia data to enable content-based queries.  The model empowers users of an FLS display to annotate the illuminations by adding semantics to the data, extending a multimedia repository with information and knowledge.  We present a core conceptual model and demonstrate its extensions for two diverse applications, authoring tools with entertainment and MRI scans with healthcare.
