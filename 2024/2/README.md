# Abstract
This paper presents the design and implementation of a circular flight pattern for use by a 3D multimedia display, a Dronevision (DV).  A DV uses drones configured with light sources, Flying Light Specks (FLSs), that are battery powered.  The flight pattern enables a swarm of FLSs to enter an opening, granting them access to the charging coils to charge their batteries.  We present two algorithms for an FLS to travel from its current coordinate to rendezvous with its assigned slot on the flight pattern, Shortest Distance (SD) and Fastest Rendezvous Time (FRT).  In addition to quantifying the tradeoff associated with these algorithms, we present an implementation using a swarm of Crazyflie drones with Vicon localization.
